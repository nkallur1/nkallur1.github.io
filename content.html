Zero Waste is skilled at improving manufacturing and distribution companies’ plastic recycling programs. We also offer a leading level of market stability when it comes recycling your plastic streams. While some plastic materials are more difficult to recycle than others, we can help your company find landfill alternative solutions for any plastic resins, as well as films, foams, and dirty plastics.
 </p>
 <p>We offer combination trailers and a variety of comingled collection options, based on each client facility’s needs and capabilities. However, we will also help identify which materials would be more valuable when collected separately, and may recommend specialized equipment, such as balers or foam densifies. </p>
