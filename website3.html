  <h3>What is zero waste?</h3>
  <p style="font-size:25px;">ZERO WASTE is Eliminating the Idea of Waste by recycling the "non-recyclable" as well as "recyclable materials" Whether it's coffee capsules from your home, pens from a school, or plastic gloves from a manufacturing facility, TerraCycle can collect and recycle almost any form of waste. We partner with individual collectors such as yourself, as well as major consumer product companies, retailers, manufacturers, municipalities, and small businesses across 20 different countries. With your help, we are able to divert millions of pounds of waste from landfills and incinerators each month.  <br>   </p>
